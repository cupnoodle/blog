Insert graph of y-axis: number of share of motivational quote weekly, x-axis: ratio to be successful
the higher of number of share, the lower the ratio to be successful. 

'Entrepreneur' is the hot keyword nowadays, you see tons of post sharing [insert successful entreprenur name here] secret/tips for success/building a company/earning the first million etc circulating in social media.

Most successful/in process entrepreneur are occupied by their own business most of the time. They dont have the time luxury to wrote these motivational quote/successful tips, and you might notice that most these "quote/tips" are not posted on their own verified account, these are posted by third party website/company usually to grab your attention. Some of these quotes may be fabricated and never heard from the quoted person at all.

Reddit.com/r/entrepreneur has slowly become a self promotional dump where some redditor spams unverified claim and non actionable advices to other with a link to their own blog at the bottom of the post in order to increase traffic to their own blog. I once read a comment on the sub which mention that "successful entrepreneur or those on track are already occupied with their business all the time, those who have the time luxury to post here often is either wantrepreneur or shady marketers".

Be aware, very aware of those speakers who wants to share you their secret of success and a system that promises the same result as them. Think about it, if they are already making that much money, why would they want to share their secret with you? Would Google share their own proprietary search algorithm to Apple?  Some of them might tell you that they have earned enough and they wanted to share their secret because they found joy when they see their apprentice being successful, bullshit.

If you search "How to make money" on google, the top 20 results will teach you that the basis of how to make money online is to teach other how to make money online and charge them for it. And you remembered you paid for these promising course with dozens of testimonials, do this cycle looks farmiliar now?
