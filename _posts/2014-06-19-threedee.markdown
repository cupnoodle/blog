##Three.js
I have used this <a href="http://threejs.org/">library (Three.js)</a>. The library is free and open source to use (but the documentation is not well organized,hours spent on stack overflow troubleshooting stuff again @_@), I am really amused by the fact that 3D rendering is now
 possible using web browser. (Using WebGL technology, still lack support from some web browser like safari, etc).I am starting to believe <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-principle-of-least-power/">Atwood's Law</a> does work.

##Playground
<a href="http://kitsunechan.com/playground/1.html">Click here to see the animation</a>(May not work for safari and internet explorer)    
Not anything fancy but I had fun playing around with it.  
Bonus point for who can guess where is the origin of the animation =P.  

##Etc
Recently I have attended a cosplay event in my university, will blog about it soon ^^.
