<br>

One more week until next year, how many new year resolution you have completed this year? I only managed to complete a few Orz  


##Ruby

I started to learn Ruby through <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/ruby"> Codecademy </a> and found that their method and explanation are really simple and easy to follow, 
but their interpreter sometimes doesn't accept answer beyond their preset input, anyhow I recommend this for people who are interested in Ruby, it's really fun following their tutorial.   

Ruby is a really refined language and it has lots of preset library such as Prime class, calculating/generating prime in Ruby takes only about three lines. 
Other than that, its variable doesn't bound by preset memory size such as <code>int</code> in C++ only hold 4 bytes of memory thus the value cannot exceed 65535 (unsigned).
I really like the flexibility of ruby althought I still can't get used to not typing semicolon, I still type semicolon at the end of every line in ruby =P.  

Well then, thats all from this update.
