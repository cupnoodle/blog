Like majority of the middle class population, I chose to enroll to an University after high school. I pursued a bachelor degree on Computer Science
because I really like programming and other course doesn't seems to piqued my interest. I remembered I was very enthusiastic, hoping to meet like-minded hobbyist and code some nifty app together.

## Why did you choose computer science?  

I was curious about the motivation of others that time and asked this question to my friends and acquaintance which I met in the course.

_"Because it has good future prospect, I heard programmer earns a lot"_

_"Because my parents wanted me to study this course"_

_"Because most of my friends took this course"_
