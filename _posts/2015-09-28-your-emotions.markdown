## Emotions ðŸ˜¬

p/s : Post with title starting with _"Writings #"_ are random writings I write for practice or fun ðŸ˜—

Most of the time you will see me with a spaced out emotion or with slight smile, I don't usually reflect my thought on my facial emotion or you can say that I am not that good at expressing myself using emotions. A bit similar to [Elliot Alderson](http://mrrobot.wikia.com/wiki/Elliot_Alderson).

I usually let loose my emotion when electronics doesn't work properly. Computer and electronic device always get on my nerve when they didn't work as expected or when they exhibit lag, it's kinda ironic to say this but I like computer so much that I hate computer. Although computer will perform as you instructed most of the time, it is extremely prone to error. It will show you blue screen of death for no reason, it will quit application suddenly when you didn't save your work, it will suddenly freeze when you are in the middle of skype interviewing and etc. It doesn't matter if your computer runs Windows, OS X or Linux, because [they all suck](http://blog.codinghorror.com/because-they-all-suck/). Okay, I admit Linux and OS X did crash less frequent than Windows.

I tend to avoid showing negative emotion (i.e : angry, sad) to others as I don't want to affect their mood as they already have many things to take care of (or seems like). Welp, I did rage one time few years back but my friend said my face doesn't look like I am raging that time, he was beside me that time. I don't even have the angry look when I am angry, huh =A=. I used to confront and argue with people when they made me furious few years back , how naive I were back then. Nowadays I rarely get offended and if some people made me unhappy I will just walk away from them for a while, I gave up raging/scolding as I don't think it will have any positive effect. Instead spending time and energy exploding my emotion on others, I try to tame my negative emotion and concentrate on other stuff instead.

Occasionally I would order a drink in a cafe (usually starbucks), sit down and observe people in that cafe. The nervous and semi-focused expression of a group of students trying to rush their assignment; the cold, doubtful face of a female while listening to her male partner explaining some matter; the programmed smile and fake enthusiasm of a conman trying to lure another victim to his multi-level marketing scheme; the grin with some slight regret  on the face of two middle aged friends seemingly reminiscing their past stories. These are some of the interesting emotion I saw in the past during observation in a cafe. I find it fascinating seeing how others present how they feel on their face and I like to guess what are they thinking based on their face emotion.

What separates us and non-living things are emotion, the ability to have thought and expressing them. I think we are both lucky and unlucky to have emotion, we are free to express what we feel but we are also bounded to how we feel and might make irrational decision at times.
