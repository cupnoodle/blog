## Update
Well I have changed the blog engine from Jekyll to Ghost as I want to edit it using mobile on the go.

## Theme

This blog uses customized Rosario's [Kasper theme](https://github.com/rosario/kasper) for Jekyll. 
Feel free to fork, change, modify and re-use it.

## Plugin

I have included a modified version of [Jemoji](https://github.com/jekyll/jemoji) where you can type in emoji directly in the post and it will be converted to image on build.
